         <p>
           In computer science, digital image processing is the use of computer algorithms to perform image processing on digital
           images. As a subcategory or field of digital signal processing, digital image processing has many advantages over analog
           image processing. It allows a much wider range of algorithms to be applied to the input data and can avoid problems such
           as the build-up of noise and signal distortion during processing. Since images are defined over two dimensions (perhaps
           more) digital image processing may be modeled in the form of multidimensional systems.

     <h2>History</h2>
      <hr>
     
      <p> 
          Many of the techniques of digital image processing, or digital picture processing as it often was called, were developed
          in the 1960s at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bell Laboratories, University of
          Maryland, and a few other research facilities, with application to satellite imagery, wire-photo standards conversion,
          medical imaging, videophone, character recognition, and photograph enhancement. The cost of processing was fairly high,
          however, with the computing equipment of that era.

    <p>
          That changed in the 1970s, when digital image processing proliferated as cheaper computers and dedicated hardware became
          available. Images then could be processed in real time, for some dedicated problems such as television standards
          conversion. As general-purpose computers became faster, they started to take over the role of dedicated hardware for all
          but the most specialized and computer-intensive operations. With the fast computers and signal processors available in
          the 2000s, digital image processing has become the most common form of image processing and generally, is used because
          it is not only the most versatile method, but also the cheapest.

    Hall of Fame in 1994</p>
