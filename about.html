         What is Lorem Ipsum?
     </h2>
     <hr>
     <p>
      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard
      dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
      book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
      unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
      recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
     </p>
      
     <a href="#">I'm an inline-style link</a> <br>
     <a href="#">I'm an inline-style link with title</a> <br>
     <a href="#">I'm a reference-style link</a> <br>
     <a href="#">I'm a relative reference to a repository file</a> <br>
     <a href="#">You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions</a> <br>
     <p>Or leave it empty and use the<a href="#">link text itself.</a></p> <br>
     <p>URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. <a href="#">http://www.example.com </a> <a
      href="#">http://www.example.com</a> and sometimes example.com (but not on Github, for example).</p> <br>
   <p>Some text to show that the reference links can follow later. </p> <br>
   
   <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>

   <p>
      It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its
      layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
      'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page
      editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites
      still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
      (injected humour and the like).
   </p>

  <h3>Where does it come from?</h3> 

  <p>
   Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature
   from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
   looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of
   the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33
   of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise
   on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit
   amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

         There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell. The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to
         make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

      <p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and
      1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by
      English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>

         There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form,
         by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of
         Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum
         generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the
         Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to
         generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition,
         injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
